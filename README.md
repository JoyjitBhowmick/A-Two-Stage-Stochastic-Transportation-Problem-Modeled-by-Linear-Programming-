# A-Two-Stage-Stochastic-Transportation-Problem-Modeled-by-Linear-Programming-(OPL/CPLEX)

This study proposes a two-stage stochastic programming model of a transportation network with arc capacities. Our objective is to transport a supply of raw materials from one location (node) to another using different arcs with finite and random capacity, to satisfy requirements with minimum cost. Each location is set to be a supply node, transshipment node, or a demand node. The arcs of the base network represent the connecting routes between the facilities. The motivation of this study is to propose a simple transportation network to see if we must open all arcs to satisfy the demand while minimizing the total cost of shipments. While the demand is known, we decide which arc to use to allocate the raw materials in the first stage. The second stage decides the flow on each arc while minimizing the cost and meeting the demand. The objective function consists of the first-stage decision costs and the expected value of the second-stage recourse costs that will also include the penalty cost of not satisfying demand requirements.

Before we state our problem, let us first define the notations used in the study. Our first-stage decision variable is binary such that,
$$ z_e = 0 $$ or $$ 1$$ 

$$
\begin{aligned}
a + b &= c \\
d &= e
\end{aligned}
$$

Our second stage decision variable $x_e^s$ is the flow on arc \textit{e} in scenario $s$.

Deterministic data are defined below:
\begin{align*}
    s \ \ \ \ \ \ & \text{scenario,} \ \ \ \  \forall s = 1,...,S \\ 
    f_e \ \ \ \ \ \ & \text{fixed charge for using arc} \ e \\
    c_e \ \ \ \ \ \ & \text{cost of shipping one unit using arc} \ e \\
    d \ \ \ \ \ \ & \text{demand}  \\
    p_s \ \ \ \ \ \ & \text{probability}
\shortintertext{%
\hspace{1.55cm}  Random data used in the models are defined below:%
}
    u_e^s \ \ \ \ \ \ & \text{full capacity of arc} \ e \\
    y_e^s \ \ \ \ \ \ & \text{unmet demand at arc} \ e \\
    \sigma_e^s \ \ \ \ \ \ & \text{cost of shortfall}
\end{align*}

In our network model, node A and B are supply nodes, node C, D, E, F are transshipment nodes, and node G is a demand node. Now we will define our linear program,
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{ll@{}ll}
    \min_{x,y,z}      &   \sum_{e=1}^8 f_e z_e + \sum_{s=1}^S \bigg( \sum_{e=1}^8 p_s x_e^s c_e + p_s y_e^s \sigma_e^s \bigg) \\
    \text{subject to} &   z_e \in  \{0,1\},\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ e=1 ,\dots, 8 \\
                      & 0  \le x_e^s  \le u_e^sz_e \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \forall s = 1,...,S \\
                      & \sum_{e=1}^8 x_e^s  \ge d- y_e^s \\
                      & x_7^s + x_8^s = d- y_e^s \\
                      & x_1^s + x_2^s = x_4^s \\
                      & x_5^s + x_6^s = x_5^s \\
                      & x_4^s + x_5^s = x_7^s \\
                      & x_6^s         = x_8^s
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

We first have the constraint on our first-stage binary variable defined earlier. We also want the flow on arc $e$ in scenario $s$ to be nonnegative, but less than or equal to the full capacity of arc $e$, if used, i.e. 
$$0 \le x_e^s \le u_e^sz_e \ \ \forall s = 1,...,S$$ The sum of all flows on arc $e$ in each scenario $s$ must be greater than or equal to the difference in demand and the shortfall, i.e. $$\sum_{e \ \text{into destination}} x_e^s \ge d-y_e^s$$ The equality constraints are the flow conservation for each $s$.
