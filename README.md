# A-Two-Stage-Stochastic-Transportation-Problem-Modeled-by-Linear-Programming-(OPL/CPLEX)

This study proposes a two-stage stochastic programming model of a transportation network with arc capacities. Our objective is to transport a supply of raw materials from one location (node) to another using different arcs with finite and random capacity, to satisfy requirements with minimum cost. Each location is set to be a supply node, transshipment node, or a demand node. The arcs of the base network represent the connecting routes between the facilities. The motivation of this study is to propose a simple transportation network to see if we must open all arcs to satisfy the demand while minimizing the total cost of shipments. While the demand is known, we decide which arc to use to allocate the raw materials in the first stage. The second stage decides the flow on each arc while minimizing the cost and meeting the demand. The objective function consists of the first-stage decision costs and the expected value of the second-stage recourse costs that will also include the penalty cost of not satisfying demand requirements.

In our network model (shown above), node A and B are supply nodes, node C, D, E, F are transshipment nodes, and node G is a demand node. 

## Notations
Before we model the linear program, let us first define the notations used in the study. Our first-stage decision variable is binary such that,

Now we will define our linear program,

The equality constraints represent the flow conservation for each s. We first have the constraint on our first-stage binary variable defined earlier. We also want the flow on arc e in scenario s to be nonnegative, but less than or equal to the full capacity of arc e, if used, i.e.

The sum of all flows on arc e in each scenario s must be greater than or equal to the difference in demand and the shortfall, i.e.
